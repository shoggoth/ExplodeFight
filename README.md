# Explode Fight III
branch exp/buttons

## Current Tasks

### DONE
- Make sure that the buttons can coexist with touches in a sprite view without having a separate view.
- Investigate setting textures on the buttons.
- See if buttons can be made up of labels that are children of some shape as well as having textures.

## Next Tasks

### BLOCKED
- Set shader code on the button. In Xcode 12.1 this causes a fault in decoding the scene.
