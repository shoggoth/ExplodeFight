# Explode Fight III
exp/shoot

## Current Tasks
- Decide which of the 3 methods I have thought of already are worth investigating and if there are others that I haven't thought of.

### SKAction driven
- I think this might be the most efficient.
- Can collision be detected and the node be removed after the collision but before the end of the action?

### Physics driven
- Might this be less efficient?
- Could this be saved for missile projectiles?

### GKAgent driven
- Somewhat more complex possibly?
- Has the advantage that it will allow in flight changes to the missile trajectory
- Might be useful for 'smart' weaponry.

### DONE
