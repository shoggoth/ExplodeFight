## Current Tasks

### DONE
- Use a texture atlas for the robot sprite and check the app package contents to make sure it looks sane.
- Experiment with the entities and agents a little bit (branched onto exp/spawner to work on this)
- Bring in the spawner resources and demo code from the Royal Flush codebase a few commits ago.
