master

## Current Tasks

### DONE
- Button experiments on branch exp/buttons.
- Shader and component experiments on exp/shaders.
- Touch joystick experiments on exp/joystick.

- Make the viewcontroller load an SKScene rather than a GKScene to avoid the problems with the sprite editor.
- Look at making SceneManager functions an extension, perhaps on SKView.
- Move the spawner and the other functions to the framework from RF.

## Next Tasks
- Explosion shaders.
- Device screen size independance. Placing of components such as HUD bits with expanded playfield on larger devices.
- Get the robot animation back in and remind myself of how animations and sprites are loaded from sks files.
