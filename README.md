master   Where were EFI and EFII? Never made it lads.

## Current Tasks
- Make the viewcontroller load an SKScene rather than a GKScene to avoid the problems with the sprite editor.
- Look at making SceneManager functions an extension, perhaps on SKView.
- Finish the touch joystick controls and add them to the framework.
- (branch) Add a shader and a component to test that the above is working.

### DONE
- Move the spawner and the other functions to the framework from RF.
- Button experiments on branch exp/buttons.
