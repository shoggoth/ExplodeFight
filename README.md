# Explode Fight III
exp/spawner

## Current Tasks
- Simplify the spawner to create and destroy one kind of sprite node.
- Extend the simple spawner to provide the sort of multiple spawn functionality we have now 'MultiSpawner', call it maybe.

### DONE
- Abstract the factory component from the spawn node so that it can be used independantly of the scene.
- Add recycling to the spawner in the same manner as with the weapon.
- Use a texture atlas for the robot sprite and check the app package contents to make sure it looks sane.
- Experiment with the entities and agents a little bit (branched onto exp/spawner to work on this)
- Bring in the spawner resources and demo code from the Royal Flush codebase a few commits ago.

## Next Tasks
