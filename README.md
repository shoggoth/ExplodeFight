# Explode Fight III
exp/mechanics

## Current Tasks
- Experiment a bit with the state machines and rules to increase understanding of these concepts and their usefulness.
- Add rules for the distance of the agent to the agent it's following.
- Create a state machine that switches state with distance from the agent it's following.
- Switch behaviours depending on the state machine.
- If the Agent has its position set to somewhere outside the playfield then kill it and remove the sprite node.
- Find out why a new spawn is affecting nodes that have already spawned.

### DONE

## Next Tasks
- Add contact detection and see if the rules and behaviours can be improved by reacting to this sort of input.
